<h1>Advanced magento canonical</h1>

<h2>Custom module that allows using category url in product's canonical url</h2>

In order to avoid having duplicate canonicals, disable product canonicals from backoffice

Limitations
- it only work with the first category (or at least the first that magento retrieve from getCategoryIds)
